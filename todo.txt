List of things to do on the hearts game:

1) SIMULATE PLAY METHOD
	-> Support for starting halfway through a trick
	-> Add a overloaded method that takes an optional state with this info.
		-> This is found in the Double Dummy playout method














SOME NOTES:

SELECT METHOD:

Currently, the select method works in a very naive fashion.
For each node, we calculate the average score of that node,
and then we subtract this from 13 to get X. We then add
X + 1 of the node to an array.

Once we have done this for all nodes, we randomly select from
this array. This is a very simple approach for biasing nodes
with a low average score.
