THINGS WE NEED TO DO FOR DoubleDummyModular CLASS:

1) Add player type info to the State class so it may be retrieved.

2) Add static methods to the player type classes that will play
   a card in a DoubleDummy environment. We then call this from 
   the PlayOut method in our DoubleDummyModular class.

3) Set up the class to play out the rounds, keeping other things the same.
